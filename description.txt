# Special Thanks:
To you! I enjoy makin' content for Terraria, and I'm glad that folks enjoy my silly mod.

Psst... wanna know a secret?
1. The "Strategy Guide" accessory is a reference to the Terraria Wiki. But you probably already knew that.
2. Expect more references in the future. 
3. This was inspired by Calamity; but also by my own timeline for my characters. Each accessory was canonically made by the character you see in the mod's icon! (Yes, that's me. I'm a plushcat.)
4. Trans rights. <3
